# Malaria-Cell-Project
Image analysis of 27,000 cells, half with malaria, half healthy

These branches are based on different directions I took the project on different days.  Also instead of 
putting a bunch of different neural networks all in the same notebook I split up some of the different 
networks into different notebooks.
